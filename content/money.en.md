My income is composed as follows:

- My research activity as a contractual PhD student pays 1500 € net a month. It is 25% less than my first job as a data engineer.
- Each hour of lecturing pays 40 € gross.

I make monthly donations:

- To [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/giving), up to 5% of my fixed salary.
- To [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LandingPage) and [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/): 20 €.
- To some content creators I like: 10 €.

I practice time exchange with people who want to:

1. I give you x hours of my time to make you autonomous on a topic you're interested in.
2. You give me x hours of your time to make me autonomous on a topic I'm interested in.

The idea for this page came to me after reading the blog [détour.studio](https://détour.studio/argent/).
