Between 2021 and 2024, I was a PhD student in the [KerData](https://team.inria.fr/kerdata/) team at [Inria centre at Rennes University](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university), supervised by [Alexandru Costan](https://team.inria.fr/kerdata/alexandru-costan/) and [Gabriel Antoniu](https://team.inria.fr/kerdata/gabriel-antoniu/). My research interests cover various aspects of continual learning workloads in distributed settings (HPC, clouds and edge devices). In 2022, I did a student appointment at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/), Chicago with [Bogdan Nicolae](https://www.bnicolae.net/), trying to scale such workloads on many GPUs. My research field could be referred to as "Systems for AI". I defended my PhD in November 2024.

I hold a degree in electrical engineering from INSA Rennes. In 2019, I did an internship at [Snips](https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2019/Sonos-Announces-Acquisition-of-Snips), Paris working on the integration of an AI voice assistant on edge devices. I then joined Inria as an engineer to develop a software prototype which addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art storage solutions for stream processing.

## Duties

I am a member of [Sciences, Environment and Society group](https://sens-rennes.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) in Rennes: we are questioning our research areas in the light of current and future climate challenges. Besides, I have reviewed 10+ papers for IEEE IPDPS, ACM/IEEE CCGrid, ACM/IEEE Supercomputing, IEEE Big Data, ACM HPDC, Springer Computing journal.
