Hello! I'm Thomas Bouvier, and I'm a french data engineer. You've found my blog, where I share my technical experiences designing and developing software. I also geek out over computer science topics, command line tools, and good programming practices.

I'm currently working at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/). I also was an intern at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/) and [Snips](https://snips.ai/). I graduated in Electronics and Computer Science from [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/). You can have a look at my resume: [english](/resume/resume_thomas_bouvier.pdf), [french](/resume/cv_thomas_bouvier.pdf).

To ask me anything, say hello at contact@thomas-bouvier.io. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomas-bouvier), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-bouvier/) or [Skype](skype:thomas.bouvier@outlook.fr).
