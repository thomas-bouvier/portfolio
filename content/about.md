Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Thomas Bouvier, a french data engineer. I'm living in Rennes.

You've found my blog, where I share my technical experiences designing and developing software. I also geek out over computer science topics, tools, and share my thoughts on various random topics.

Currently, I am a PhD student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), working on improving the performance of distributed deep learning workloads.

You can have a look at my resume: [english](/resume/resume_thomas_bouvier.pdf), [french](/resume/cv_thomas_bouvier.pdf). To ask me anything, say hello at [contact@thomas-bouvier.io](mailto:contact@thomas-bouvier.io). You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomas-bouvier), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-bouvier/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tbouvier_).
