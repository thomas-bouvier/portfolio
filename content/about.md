title: "About me"
---

I'm Thomas Bouvier, and I'm a french data engineer. You've found my blog, where I share my technical experiences designing and developing software. I also geek out over computer science topics, tools, and good programming practices.

After-hours, I love to talk about science communication, climate & energy, critical thinking, effective altruism, but also running, trekking, record collecting, guitar playing (finger-picking), creative coding, webdesign...

I'm currently working at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/). You can have a look at my resume: [english](/resume/resume_thomas_bouvier.pdf), [french](/resume/cv_thomas_bouvier.pdf).

To ask me anything, say hello at [contact@thomas-bouvier.io](mailto:contact@thomas-bouvier.io). You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomas-bouvier), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-bouvier/) or [Skype](skype:thomas.bouvier@outlook.fr).
