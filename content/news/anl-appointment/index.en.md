This summer, I will be working as a visiting PhD student at Argonne National Lab, in the context of the [UNIFY Associate Team](https://team.inria.fr/unify/). I will be mentored by [Bogdan Nicolae](http://bnicolae.net/).

My work is part of the ongoing ["Towards Continual Learning at Scale" JLESC project](https://jlesc.github.io/projects/continual_learning_project/). The project aims to achieve two main objectives: the (1) design and implementation of a distributed replay buffer leveraging distributed systems effectively and the (2) study of trade-offs introduced by large-scale CL in terms of training time, accuracy and memory usage. All experiments will be conducted on the [ALCF Polaris](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/polaris) supercomputer.
