The Fresk-type awareness workshops enable the engagement of various sectors of activity (industries, transportation, food, buildings, etc.) in their necessary transitions, both in France and around the world.

Currently, tools to manage these events (ticketing, opportunity sharing, pathways, resources) are provided by workshop developers, but this is done in a heterogeneous and non-shared manner.

This poses several problems:

- Workshop developers invest in parallel to develop or finance external solutions without pooling these resources.

- Facilitators and local groups face a multitude of tools with different interfaces and processes, which complicates their experience and prevents multi-workshop management.

- Participants cannot easily access opportunities to participate in other workshops and thus continue their awareness journey.

In collaboration with the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/), the [Digital Collage](https://digitalcollage.org/), and the [Find a Fresk taskforce](https://www.findafresk.org/taskforce/), we are launching the OpenFresque digital commons. This project aims to develop two types of open-source tools:

- Platforms for workshop developers that are easily deployable and customizable for managing their events and communities. The first functional component is a ticketing system, adapted from the existing one of the Climate Fresk, and released under the GNU AGPL 3.0 license.

- Multi-workshop tools usable by local communities, based on the aggregation of data exposed via APIs by the standardized tools of each workshop developer.

These tools will accelerate the spread of multi-sectoral workshops worldwide and will also strengthen:

- The sense of belonging within communities through a digital commons project.
- Collaboration among workshop developers.
- Awareness of digital commons within these engaged networks.
