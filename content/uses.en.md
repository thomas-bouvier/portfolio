title: "What I use"
---

I am somewhat opposed to making this page, since I want people to want less, not more.

## Hardware

- Apple [MacBook Pro 14" 2023](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111340) (M2 Max) as my laptop.
- I set up my desktop computer in 2012, which I've been evolving over time ever since.
- Screen: LG 34WN780-B
- Phone: Samsung Galaxy S10e
- Input devices: Logitech MX Keys & MX Master 3
- NAS: Synology DS723+ & Synology DS214play

- Bikes: Elops Single Speed 500, and an old 1980 Peugeot bike that a friend completely restored ðŸš²

## Software

- Computer OS: I am using NixOS with [Lix](https://lix.systems/) because reproducibility is important to me. You can find my config [here](https://github.com/thomas-bouvier/dotfiles). My MacBook is supported thanks to the [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/) project.
